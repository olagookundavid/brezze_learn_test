Built with a focus on user experience and functionality, Chatbox aims to provide a streamlined and enjoyable social networking experience.

## Architecture and Design Decisions

- The use of Provider simplifies code maintenance and enhances scalability, enabling the app to accommodate future feature enhancements and optimizations.

### Error Handling and Loading States
- Error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the app to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- Loading states are incorporated to indicate ongoing operations, ensuring users are informed of background tasks and data retrieval processes.
- By managing errors and loading states effectively, the app maintains user confidence and enhances overall usability.

### User Interface and Experience
- The app's user interface is designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and intuitive navigation.
- The choice of portrait mode ensures a consistent and optimized experience across devices, catering to the preferences and usage patterns of mobile users.
